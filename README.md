<h1>6DoF TRACKING OF A VR HEADSET</h2>
<h3>Discrption</h3>
<p>Program that implements a system that tracks a model with ArUco markers attached on it and designed to be mounted on the headset. The tracking system estemates the 3D pose of the calibrated camera with respect to the n points on the model by solving PnP(Perspective-n-Points) problem after the detection of ArUco markers. The resulting information of the tracking system, the rotation (roll, pitch, and yaw) and 3D translation of the camera with respect to the world, is sent to the mobile device(Andriod). The information can be used in any 6DoF VR application for detecting user's headmovments and orientation.</P


<h3> Crafting The Mounted Model</h3>
<p>
The 3D mounted model can found in the file Model.skp . The model can be viewed using SketchUp (can be downloaded for free). All the measurements can be done that model, also the coordinated of coner of the markers.

It is better to craftthe model using low-wight metrials like hard cardbord. Also it's better to  get the
